This is a technical project on landmass generation i made to improve my skills in game developement

## Landmass generation
Each landmass chunk is generated by first making a square of triangles, after that height is calculated for each vertex of the tringles that make the mesh.
The height is calculated using different layers of noise

## Chunks
Landmass chunks are generated based on the distance from the player.
If the player gets far enoght away from a loaded chunk this is hidden but is still loaded to avoid having to reload said chunk

Water has animated textures and makes the player float to allow him to land in it
